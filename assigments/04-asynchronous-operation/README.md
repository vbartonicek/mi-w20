# Assigment 04 - RESTfull - Asynchronous operation
Design and implement simple service - remove customer from your database.

DELETE /customer/{id}

Assume that this operation requires confirmation by human. It should not be implemented as synchronous operation. Design and implement this operation in an asynchronous manner. You can simulate the confirmation as delay 10s or implement another service to confirm deletion.
