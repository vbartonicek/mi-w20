# Assigment 07 - RESTful - Pagination
Design and implement simple service - list of orders.

    GET /orders
Assume that this request (at /orders URI) returns large number of orders. It is not appropriate to return the whole list at once. Design and implement this operation with pagination using the Link HTTP header.

Use http://nodejs.org and http module.
